Use the shortcode [NikeFuel Display] to show an animated widget of any of your Nike+ Runs. 

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin for wordpress to highlight any Nike+ runs that you have taken with their app. This app is not affiliated with Nike or NikeFuel or Nike+ in anyway - we do encourage you to use their products though!

Special thanks to <a href="http://nikeplusphp.org/">Nike+PHP</a> for their framework (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/nike-plus-php/">GNU GPL Licence</a>). Also, thank you to Better2Web for their <a href="http://widgets.better2web.com/loader/">Percentage Loader</a> (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/Better2Web/jquery.percentageloader">BSD Licenced</a>). 

You can only have one version of the NikeFuel display on a page at any given time. 

Okay, that's all for now. I'm late for my afternoon run!

Enjoy!
